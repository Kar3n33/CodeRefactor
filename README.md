# Semantics Homework 01

Description:

We wanted to create semantic elements for our html code to define our content more clearly, using some of the basic elements we are able to have a more organized code that will allow multiple people working on a code better guidance for the formatting of the website.

For this particular project we are changing the original website code from non-semantic elements to show more semanantic elements. This gives your page a more organized look and makes it more accessible for other users.

There were some challenges in this project to have the links between working in VSC and pushing my changes to Github, even though my VSC code shows the website with the appropriate layout we were trying to achieve, for some reason after making changes my github website went from 404 not found, to not showing anything but my title header. I will continue to update this until the link is working appropriately.
